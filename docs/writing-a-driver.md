# Writing a `.rhai` driver

A checklist-shaped recipe for adding one device driver to this repository (rusthinq's `[scripting] rhai_dir`). Read
[il-rusthinq.md](https://github.com/3735943886/rusthinq/blob/master/docs/il-rusthinq.md) first for what each hook means and what the host does around
it (that document is in the rusthinq repository); this document is the step-by-step of turning a device's wire protocol into one. It is
written to be read by an AI agent driving the work as much as by a person.

## 0. What you need before writing anything

- **Real evidence**: frames actually captured from the appliance (rethink's test suite,
  a live capture over `raw_prefix`, an existing TS driver's own doc comments citing a capture).
  Never invent a field's meaning; an offset nothing has confirmed stays unpublished (see
  every existing driver's "not exercised in a capture, so not read here" comments).
- **The old TS driver, if one exists** (`rethink/cloud/devices/<Model>.ts` in the sibling
  checkout): it is the functional spec. Match what it does (which properties, which writes,
  which quirks), not its entity names/ids/topics — those are HA-adapter-specific and out of
  scope (the standing distinction is "function, not naming").
- **The IL spec** (`../ildevice/il.md` and friends, normative): the descriptor/values/
  commands/rejects you publish must fit it. How you get there in Rhai is free.
- **Can you capture live?** If the device is connected to a running rusthinq with
  `raw_prefix` set (and `raw` lists at least `rx`, `tx`, `clip_tx`), use
  **`rusthinq-capture <mqtt-host[:port]> <device-uuid> [out.jsonl]`**
  (in the rusthinq repository, `crates/rusthinq-tools/src/bin/rusthinq_capture.rs`) rather than subscribing by hand: it
  taps `rx`/`tx`/`clip/tx` together into one timestamped, TLV/AABB-decoded JSONL file, so rx
  and tx frames are never split across two separate subscriptions racing each other (a real
  write's ack has been missed this way before — don't repeat it). **Set `RUSTHINQ_PREFIX` to
  the target's `[mqtt] raw_prefix`, not `rusthinq_prefix`** — the two are usually different
  values and the tool's own `--help`-adjacent doc comment used to say the wrong one; get this
  wrong and the tool subscribes to a topic nothing publishes and silently captures zero
  events (indistinguishable from "device is idle" until you notice the file never grows).
  Stdin lines become
  timestamped `note` entries in the same file, so ask whoever is operating the real app to
  send a line ("smart_care on") right when they do each thing, and correlate by timestamp
  afterward instead of guessing from wall-clock chat messages. A read-only status query is
  safe to inject via `<raw_prefix>/<id>/raw/inject/set` (same bytes `send_raw`/`aabb_wrap`/
  `tlv_frame_build` would produce, full wire framing included); do not inject a write/command
  frame against a real appliance without the user's sign-off. See `raw_bus.rs`'s doc comment
  for the full topic list.
  **Independent of `raw_prefix` entirely**: `rusthinq-packet-parser`/`rusthinq-packet-sender`
  talk straight to the device's own `clip/message/devices/<id>` topic (what `raw/clip/tx` is
  itself a copy of) — useful when `raw` isn't configured, though as shipped they only build
  TLV frames, not AABB.
  **A write via rusthinq's own `<rusthinq_prefix>/<id>/<prop>/set` and one relayed from the
  real app through an active LG-cloud bridge session end up on the exact same wire path**
  (`ConnectedAsLocal::send_to_local` → the same `send_to_device` a script's `ctx.send_raw`
  uses) — a write that looks unacknowledged from rusthinq's own path is almost always a
  capture gap (see above) or genuine appliance-side flakiness (busy/mid-cycle; this fleet has
  precedent for an acked write the appliance still ignored), not a different code path.

## 1. Identify the frame family

| family | framing | shared module | pick when |
|---|---|---|---|
| TLV | `[hdr..] len [tag,val].. crc16` | `tlv_common.rhai` (`import "tlv_common" as c;`) | the device answers a caps/values handshake (CST_570004_WW, DHUM_056905_WW, AIR_910604_WW) |
| AABB, fixed status | `AA len inner csum BB`, inner is a flat byte record | `aabb_common.rhai` | the device pushes/answers with one fixed-layout status record (1WPU4CIGCR__2, WBEY3GT, 2RSFL2DBN3K_Z) |
| AABB, monitoring record | `AA len inner csum BB`, inner has its own sub-framing (`addr, cmd, [0, len, payload]..`) | `monitoring_common.rhai` (itself imports `aabb_common`) | washer/dryer/styler family (F24VDD, RH14_N_KR, S3BF_POD_DN4, Pd0F_F) |

A module cannot call back into its importer, so the device script keeps every hook
(`start`, `on_data`, `on_set_property`, ...) and delegates plain parsing/framing to the module
(`c::...`). Read the existing driver closest to the new device's family before writing
anything — copy its shape, not its bytes.

## 2. The descriptor

```rhai
fn descriptor(ctx) {
    json_stringify(#{
        il: 0,
        kind: "...",                 // section 10 of il.md if it should form a composite
        label: "...",                // a generic fallback; the host substitutes the owner's
                                      // own name for the device when it has one
        vendor: "LG",
        model: ctx.model_id(),
        props: #{ ... }
    })
}
```

- **One property per thing the old driver published**, no more. Its name is a free
  `[a-z0-9_]+` string (`il.md` section 3); reuse the TS driver's own MQTT property name unless
  it collides with a role name below.
- **Roles** (`il.md` section 9) are what let a consumer build a composite (climate,
  humidifier, fan, ...) or a generic UI hint (`available`). Use one only when the property
  really is that thing; do not force a role to fit (a fridge's two independent setpoints get
  no `target_temperature` role — there is no composite for two thermostats, so they stay plain
  `number` properties with `class: "temperature"`).
- **`class`/`series`/`category`** (section 11) on every property where one applies — a
  consumer that does not know a class ignores it (L-1), so there is no cost to adding one.
  `series: "counter"` for a running total that resets (today's water dispensed); `category:
  "diagnostic"` for a fault code or a filter counter; `category: "config"` for a setting a
  person sets once, not an everyday control.
- **`requires`** for a control that only takes effect under a condition the device itself
  enforces (a burner ring that ignores commands unless the panel granted remote start) — the
  host checks it before the script ever sees the write.
- A property the wire cannot yet confirm the meaning of is **left out**, not guessed.

## 3. The hooks

| hook | when | typical body |
|---|---|---|
| `start(ctx)` | device connected | send a status query if the device does not report on its own (`ctx.send_raw(...)`); AABB monitoring/status-pushing devices often need nothing here |
| `publish_config(ctx)` | called once right after `start`, and again on a host resync | `ctx.publish_il(descriptor(ctx));` — must be safe to call twice, so build the descriptor fresh from current `ctx.state_get`/`state_has`, never accumulate |
| `on_data(ctx, data)` | every frame from the device | discriminate the frame kind (first byte(s)/tag), decode, `ctx.publish_property(name, canonical_text)` |
| `on_set_property(ctx, prop, value)` | a command already validated against the descriptor (type/options/range/step/`requires`) reached this device | build and `ctx.send_raw(...)` the write frame; `c::reject(ctx, prop, reason)` for anything the script itself must still refuse (an unknown `prop`, a value the descriptor's static range cannot express) |
| `on_drop(ctx)` | device disconnected | `ctx.publish_property("available", "false")` |

Everything else (timers, `on_timer`, TLV handshake retries) is what the shared module or
`il-rusthinq.md`'s hook table cover; most single-status AABB devices need none of it.

## 4. Descriptor that changes after connecting

A device whose valid range or unit depends on something only known after the first frame
(a capability query's reported min/max, a display unit the appliance is currently set to)
follows this shape, used by `CST_570004_WW.rhai` (capability-driven range) and
`2RSFL2DBN3K_Z.rhai` (unit-driven range):

```rhai
fn unit(ctx) { let u = ctx.state_get("unit"); if u == () { "C" } else { u } }  // a sane default

fn status(ctx, r, o) {
    let u = decode_unit(r[o + N]);
    if u != unit(ctx) {
        ctx.state_set("unit", u);
        ctx.publish_il(descriptor(ctx));  // republish: the descriptor just changed
    }
    // ... publish values using u ...
}
```

`publish_config` still publishes a descriptor with the default eagerly at `start` — never
withhold the descriptor waiting for data the device might not send for a while.

## 5. Writes

Three shapes cover every driver so far; pick by what the appliance's own write frame turns
out to look like (verify against a captured accepted write before choosing):

1. **Tag-attach (TLV)**: `c::write(ctx, tag, value, [other_tags_to_carry])` — the shared
   TLV module handles current-value lookup and framing; the third argument is which other
   tags a write of this one must also carry (a mode write also needs power=on, for instance).
   See `CST_570004_WW.rhai`.
2. **All-`0xFF`-but-one template (AABB)**: build `[0xf0, cmd]` then push `0xFF` for
   every offset except the one being set — valid when a captured accepted write really is
   uniform apart from the one field. See `1WPU4CIGCR__2.rhai`'s `set_field`.
3. **Literal captured template (AABB)**: `hex_decode(base_hex_string())` then mutate the
   specific byte(s) as a `Blob` (`msg[offset] = value;`, works directly — `Engine::new()`'s
   default `Blob` package is loaded) — required when the real write frame carries fixed
   non-`0xFF` marker bytes elsewhere that a generic fill would lose (comment why, cite the
   capture). See `2RSFL2DBN3K_Z.rhai`'s `write_field`.

In every shape: **nothing is published from a write.** The appliance's own next status frame
is what moves the property; a rejected write just leaves it where it was.

## 6. Rhai gotchas specific to this engine

- Rhai functions cannot see a top-level `const`/`let` — write a zero-argument function
  instead (`fn record_len() { 26 }`), even for something that looks like a constant.
- `~` is not an operator here; use an explicit mask (`& 0xdf`).
- A `Blob` element (from `hex_decode`, `aabb_unwrap`, indexing a frame) compares directly
  against an int literal (`if inner[1] == 0xec`) and works in a `switch`; call `.to_int()`
  only when you need it in float arithmetic or string formatting (`(v / 10.0)`,
  `n.round().to_int()`).
- Slicing: there is no `array[a..b]`. For a `Blob`/`Array`, `x.extract(n)` drops the first
  `n` elements; most decoders instead pass the whole record plus an integer offset and index
  `r[offset + k]` throughout (see any `status(ctx, r, o)` function). For a `String`,
  `s.sub_string(start, len)`.
- `aabb_wrap`/`tlv_frame_build` accept either an `Array` of small ints or a `Blob`
  (`Vec<u8>`) — build with whichever is more convenient, no conversion needed.
- `hex_decode`/`hex_encode`/`hex_encode_upper`, `crc16`, `tlv_parse`/`tlv_build`,
  `tlv_frame_parse`/`tlv_frame_build`, `aabb_wrap`/`aabb_unwrap` are globally available, in
  drivers and in tests.

## 7. Tests (`tests/<Model>.test.rhai`)

Every `.rhai` driver needs one (`rusthinq-script-test` fails otherwise). Model
it on the closest existing test file for the same frame family. Minimum coverage:

- **A real frame becomes the right properties** — `expect_props(d, #{ prop: "value", .. })`
  against a captured frame (cite where it came from in a comment).
- **The descriptor** — `d.start(); let desc = d.descriptor();` (only valid after `start`, since
  that is what runs `publish_config`), check roles/class/range/label for at least the
  interesting properties.
- **Every write, byte for byte**, against a captured accepted write if one exists, else
  against the template the driver itself computes — `expect_eq(a::inner_hex(d, i), "...")` /
  `t::sent_tlvs(d, i)`. Compute the expected hex with a throwaway script, do not hand-derive
  checksums.
- **A bad write is rejected and nothing is sent**: `let n = d.sent().len(); d.set(prop,
  bad_value); expect_eq(d.sent().len(), n); expect(d.event("reject") != (), "...");` — for a
  value the *host* rejects (out of range/step/type), the device need not even be `start()`ed
  first; for one the *script* itself must reject (unknown prop), same pattern.
- **Any quirk cited in a comment gets its own test** (a wire value with two meanings, a
  field that only appears while another is true, a frame length variant).

`import "tlv_test" as t;` / `import "aabb_test" as a;` (`tests/`) hold the shared
frame-building and inspection helpers; read them before writing raw hex by hand.

## 8. Wiring it in

1. `<exact wire modelId>.rhai` — the filename is the lookup key
   (`scripting::has_script_for`), so it must match the `modelId` the device reports exactly,
   including case and underscores.
2. `tests/<Model>.test.rhai` next to it.
3. Run `rusthinq-script-test .` from this directory (build it from rusthinq: `cargo run -p
   rusthinq-devices --features scripting --bin rusthinq-script-test -- <this directory>`).
   It runs every driver test, then checks every driver has a test file and publishes a
   descriptor that is well formed against the IL.
4. Add one row to the driver table in [README.md](../README.md#drivers) stating
   exactly what was and was not verified against a real appliance — copy the phrasing style
   of an existing row, do not oversell "tested".
5. **Never point this driver's model at a device another consumer (rusthinq-adapter, a raw-bus
   tool) is already driving** — two unaware writers on one appliance. If replacing an existing
   consumer, detach it first.

## 9. Before calling it done

- [ ] `rusthinq-script-test .` — new tests pass, nothing else broke, no driver check fails
- [ ] every published property/value/reject traces to a real capture or the old TS driver's
      confirmed behavior — nothing invented
- [ ] README table row added
- [ ] if the driver needs a host function or behavior newer than `RUSTHINQ_REF`, that file
      is moved forward in the same change
